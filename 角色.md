In the traditional client-server authentication model, the client
   requests an access-restricted resource (protected resource) on the
   server by authenticating with the server using the resource owner’s
   credentials.  
简单的客户端——服务端授权模型中，客户端使用服务端给用户的凭证（密码、证书之类）去访问受保护的资源。   
   
   In order to provide third-party applications access to
   restricted resources, the resource owner shares its credentials with
   the third party.  

   
   This creates several problems and limitations:
   o  Third-party applications are required to store the resource
      owner’s credentials for future use, typically a password in
      clear-text.
   o  Servers are required to support password authentication, despite
      the security weaknesses inherent in passwords.
   o  Third-party applications gain overly broad access to the resource
      owner’s protected resources, leaving resource owners without any
      ability to restrict duration or access to a limited subset of
      resources.
   o  Resource owners cannot revoke access to an individual third party
      without revoking access to all third parties, and must do so by
      changing the third party’s password.
