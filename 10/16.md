## 10.16. Misuse of Access Token to Impersonate Resource Owner in Implicit  

[en]Flow For public clients using implicit flows, this specification does not provide any method for the client to determine what client an access token was issued to.  
[zh_CN]对于使用隐式流的公共客户端，此规范不为客户端提供任何方法来确定向哪个客户端发出了访问令牌。  
  

[en]A resource owner may willingly delegate access to a resource by granting an access token to an attacker's malicious client.  
[zh_CN]资源所有者可以通过向攻击者的恶意客户端授予访问令牌来自愿地访问资源。  
  

[en]This may be due to phishing or some other pretext.  
[zh_CN]这可能是由于网络钓鱼或其他借口。  
  

[en]An attacker may also steal a token via some other mechanism.  
[zh_CN]攻击者也可以通过其他机制盗取令牌。  
  

[en]An attacker may then attempt to impersonate the resource owner by providing the access token to a legitimate public client.  
[zh_CN]攻击者可以尝试通过向合法公共客户端提供访问令牌来模拟资源所有者。  
  

[en]In the implicit flow (response_type=token), the attacker can easily switch the token in the response from the authorization server, replacing the real access token with the one previously issued to the attacker.  
[zh_CN]在隐式流（._type=token）中，攻击者可以容易地切换来自授权服务器的响应中的令牌，用先前发布给攻击者的令牌替换实际访问令牌。  
  

[en]Servers communicating with native applications that rely on being passed an access token in the back channel to identify the user of the client may be similarly compromised by an attacker creating a compromised application that can inject arbitrary stolen access tokens.  
[zh_CN]与依赖于在后通道中传递访问令牌来标识客户端用户的本地应用程序进行通信的服务器可能同样受到创建可注入任意被盗访问令牌的受害应用程序的攻击者的破坏。  
  

[en]Any public client that makes the assumption that only the resource owner can present it with a valid access token for the resource is vulnerable to this type of attack.  
[zh_CN]任何假定只有资源所有者可以向其呈现资源的有效访问令牌的公共客户端都容易受到这种类型的攻击。  
  

[en]This type of attack may expose information about the resource owner at the legitimate client to the attacker (malicious client).  
[zh_CN]这种类型的攻击可以将合法客户端上的资源所有者的信息暴露给攻击者（恶意客户端）。  
  

[en]This will also allow the attacker to perform operations at the legitimate client with the same permissions as the resource owner who originally granted the access token or authorization code.  
[zh_CN]这也将允许攻击者以与最初授予访问令牌或授权代码的资源所有者相同的权限在合法客户端上执行操作。  
  

[en]Authenticating resource owners to clients is out of scope for this specification.  
[zh_CN]将资源所有者认证给客户端不在本规范的范围内。  
  

[en]Any specification that uses the authorization process as a form of delegated end-user authentication to the client (e.g., third-party sign-in service) MUST NOT use the implicit flow without additional security mechanisms that would enable the client to determine if the access token was issued for its use (e.g., audience- restricting the access token).  
[zh_CN]使用授权过程作为委托给客户端的最终用户身份验证形式的任何规范（例如，第三方登录服务）必须不使用隐式流，而不需要额外的安全机制，这些机制将使客户端能够确定是否针对i.TS使用（例如，观众限制访问令牌）。
