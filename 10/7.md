## 10.7. Resource Owner Password Credentials  

[en]The resource owner password credentials grant type is often used for legacy or migration reasons.  
[zh_CN]资源所有者密码凭据授予类型通常用于遗留或迁移原因。  
  

[en]It reduces the overall risk of storing usernames and passwords by the client but does not eliminate the need to expose highly privileged credentials to the client.  
[zh_CN]它降低了客户端存储用户名和密码的总体风险，但不消除向客户端公开高特权凭证的需要。  
  

[en]This grant type carries a higher risk than other grant types because it maintains the password anti-pattern this protocol seeks to avoid.  
[zh_CN]这种授权类型比其他授权类型具有更高的风险，因为它维护了该协议试图避免的密码反模式。  
  

[en]The client could abuse the password, or the password could unintentionally be disclosed to an attacker (e.g., via log files or other records kept by the client).  
[zh_CN]客户端可能滥用密码，或者密码可能无意中泄露给攻击者（例如，通过客户端保存的日志文件或其他记录）。  
  

[en]Additionally, because the resource owner does not have control over the authorization process (the resource owner's involvement ends when it hands over its credentials to the client), the client can obtain access tokens with a broader scope than desired by the resource owner.  
[zh_CN]此外，由于资源所有者对授权过程没有控制权（资源所有者的参与在将其凭证交给客户端时结束），因此客户端可以获得比资源所有者期望的范围更广的访问令牌。  
  

[en]The authorization server should consider the scope and lifetime of access tokens issued via this grant type.  
[zh_CN]授权服务器应该考虑通过这种授予类型发布的访问令牌的范围和生存期。  
  

[en]The authorization server and client SHOULD minimize use of this grant type and utilize other grant types whenever possible.  
[zh_CN]授权服务器和客户端应尽量减少使用此授予类型，并尽可能使用其他授予类型。
