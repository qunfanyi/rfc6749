[zh_CN]访问令牌凭据（以及任何机密访问令牌属性）必须在传输和存储中保持机密，并且仅在授权服务器、访问令牌有效的资源服务器以及向其颁发访问令牌的客户端之间共享。

[zh_CN]访问令牌凭证必须仅使用第1.6节中描述的TLS，使用[RFC2818]定义的服务器身份验证进行传输。  
  

[en]When using the implicit grant type, the access token is transmitted in the URI fragment, which can expose it to unauthorized parties.  
[zh_CN]当使用隐式授权类型时，访问令牌在URI片段中传输，URI片段可以将访问令牌暴露给未授权方。

[en]This specification does not provide any methods for the resource server to ensure that an access token presented to it by a given client was issued to that client by the authorization server.  
[zh_CN]本规范没有为资源服务器提供任何方法，以确保授权服务器向给定客户端颁发了由给定客户端呈现给它的访问令牌。
